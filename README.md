## TODO

- [ ] add position evaluation pondering


- [ ] use zobrist hashing for transposition


- [ ] when you drop a piece to put it back, the hints should still render


- [ ] benchmark perf


- [ ] move computation heavy functions away from the render functions


- [ ] wasm in webworker


- [ ] lint + clean code (camelcase snakecase)


- [ ] allow drawing/marking on board


- [ ] the dragging doesn't stop on right mouse down but on right mouse up


- [ ] measure the real tile size (might be 1px off)


- [ ] the pieces seem ~1px off from the tile center


- [ ] right clic drag stop does not clear the hints
